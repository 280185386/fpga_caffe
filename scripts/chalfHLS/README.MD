mulHLS: custom precision multiplication with rounding to nearest  
mulHLS_roundOFF: custom precision multiplication with rounding to zero  
adderHLS: custom precision addition with rounding to nearest  
adderHLS_roundOFF: custom precision addition with rounding to zero  

Description:
The programs in these folders (script.py) targets VivadoHLS 2016.3  
Testing resource utilization of customized precision operations with place and route exponent size 4-7 and mentissa size 2-14  
Reports are available in impl_reports/ of every folder  

script.py  
Run this script to test resource utilization of all exponent and mentissa range with place and route.  
Graphs will be shown automatically after HLS finishes.  
All results will also be stored in .csv file (adders_round.csv)  
This might take up to 2 hours depends on your machine.  

```python
>>> python script.py
```

After results shown in impl_reports/ run above command with -O flag to skip HLS and only generate graphs  

```python
>>> python -O script.py
```

Graphs generation assumes all test results are available in impl_reports/ (52 results in total).  
If need to generate graphs for partial results change report reading range as commented inside script.py
