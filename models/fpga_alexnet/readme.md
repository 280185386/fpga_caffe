FPGA Caffe Custom-Precision Floating-Point AlexNet
=====================================

The figures below shows the accuracy degradation of various custom-precision floating-point settings for inference using a pretrained model on the Imagenet validationg set, each of which uses round-to-zero for the multipliers and round-to-nearest for the accumulators. Convolution, max pooling, relu, and fully connected layers are implemented on the FPGA, all other layers are on the CPU.
